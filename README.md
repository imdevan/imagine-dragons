Imagine Dragons
================

This is an unsuccessful project that in which I attempted to create an augmented reality application which places the user on top of a dragon.

The user can then run around and imagine that they are riding on the back of a dragon.

I learned that working with three.js is much more complicated than working with Unity. 

Although I may come back to the project in the future I have shelved it for now.
